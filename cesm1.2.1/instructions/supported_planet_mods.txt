Supported modifications in ExoCAM
  all modifications are colleted in the file ../SourceMods/src.share/exoplanet_mod.F90
  These must be changed prior to building the model.  Please see the file for
  more details and documentation.  Below is an incomplete list of options,
  some are self-explanatory.  

  Run options:
  do_exo_synchronous  --> force synchronous rotation  

  Planet parameters:
  exo_planet_radius
  exo_surface_gravity
  exo_ndays  -- length of day scaler used for synchronous rotating worlds
  exo_scon   -- solar constant

  Atmospheric Constituents:
  exo_n2bar, exo_h2bar, exo_co2bar, exo_ch4bar
  (it is the users responsibility to make sure these selections are paired
  with correct radiative transfer)


Fun Features
  do_exo_rt_clearsky  -- do parallel clearsky radiative calculation, used for
  determining cloud forcing; include fluxes with "C" appended in user_nl_cam 
  finidat for clearsky fluxes  (i.e. FUSC, FULC, FDSC, FUSC)

  do_exo_rt_spectral  -- compute spectrally resolved radiative fluxes; include
  binned spectral fluxes in user_nl_cam finidat (i.e 'FUS_int01','FUS_int02', etc)


ExoRT Radiative Transfer Packages
  src.n28archean == H2O, CO2, CH4, N2, H2, HITRAN 2004, 28 bins, designed for
                    the Archean Climate (formerly "highco2")
                 == CO2 up to several tenths of a bar with an N2 background, CO2
                    accuracy less at higher values (not up-to-date CIA)
                 == CH4 up to 0.01 bar with an N2 background
                 == refer to Wolf, E.T. and Toon, O.B. Astrobiology 13(7), 1-18 (2013)
                 == up to 100 bar total pressures
                 == N2-N2, N2-H2, H2-H2 CIA

  src.n42h20     == H2O, N2, H2 42 bins, HITRAN 2012 
                 == refer to Kopparapu et al. ApJ 845:5 (2017)
                 == up to 10 bar total pressures
	         == N2-N2, N2-H2, H2-H2 CIA
  src.n28h2o     == same as n42h2o, 28 bins
