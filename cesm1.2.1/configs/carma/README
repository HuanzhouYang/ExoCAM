carma
++ under construction ++

Files for using carma with ExoCAM and ExoRT.  
Copy these files into SourceMods/src.cam.
These provide a linkage with ExoRT, bypassing the native framework for link with CAMRT and RRTMG.   
A basic template for a generic fractal haze carma model is included.

CAM_CONFIG_OPTS = -phys cam4 -nlev 50 -usr_src /projects/wolfet/models/ExoRT/3dmodels/src.cam.n28archean.haze -carma meteor_smoke -nadv 43
	loads basic smoke model, but this is overwritten by SourceMods files for generic fractal haze
	-nadv = number of advected constituents = (H2O water, H2O ice, H2O liquid, + N CARMA bins)
	-nlev = number of vertical levels (need higher model top for stratospheric haze
	-build with n28archean.haze ExoRT, it is the only currently supported with carma link
